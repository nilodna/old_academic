  abstract={The 2013–2014 summer in the Southeast Brazil region set records for negative precipitation anomalies and the highest sea surface temperatures. Such event was attributed to the anomalous presence of atmospheric blocking, which prevented the propagation of a cold front towards the Equator and the establishment of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone, two phenomena that regulate the precipitation regime in this area. These blocking episodes are relatively important to the climate in mid-latitudes, but the feedback of the coastal ocean is still poorly understood under these anomalous conditions. This paper investigates, from a numerical perspective, the impacts on the thermohaline properties and circulation in the South Brazil Bight (SBB). We found that enhanced shortwave radiation leads to intense surface heating and that the presence of northeasterly winds strengthens the coastal upwelling nearby Cabo Frio. The South Atlantic Coastal Waters, transported into the SBB, regulate the extreme heating in the northern half of the domain, while, in the southern half, the absence of cold waters leads to the development of a warm-water pool. The final thermohaline structure induced an enlargement and intensification of the northwestward currents south of São Sebastião Island. Between Ubatuba and Cabo Frio, in the northern half, the northeasterly winds developed an intense surface advection towards offshore, and in the northern region, compensated by an opposite advection, towards the coast. We conclude that the coastal ocean feedback could present extreme anomalous conditions during atmospheric blocking events, leading to impacts upon the thermodynamical properties. Further studies are needed to understand the impacts of these events on biogeochemical properties.},

  abstract     = {The 2014 summer, on the Brazilian southeast region, was marked by a long period of precipitation deficits and strong income of solar radiation. Such event was attributed to the anomalous presence of an atmospheric blocking, that prevented the propagation of southerly cold fronts in the region. In a single event, northeasterly winds influenced the South Brazil Bight for 24 days in a row. Using numerical modeling, this work aims to understand how this events can impact the coastal circulation, mainly in the inner and mid shelves, of the South Brazil Bight. Therefore, the hydrodynamical module from the Estuarine, Coastal and Ocean Model (ECOM) was implemented, forcing numerical simulations with reduced estuarine discharge, heat flux, reanalysis derived winds and climatological thermohaline fields. It was indentified a small advance of South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) at the bottom, being thermally blocked by the intense heating at the inner shelf. However, with the influence of northeasterly winds, the SACW filled in the water column, forcing Tropical Waters (TW) towards offshore. In the rest of the domain, the Ekman transport was identified as the main mechanism to force TW retraction in the surface layers, also inducing a small increase in the subsurface intrusion of TW. Density gradient variations on the inner shelf intensified the northeastward currents, between Cananéia and São Sebastião, also creating an enlargement of this feature. North of the São Sebastião Island, however, it was observed a weakening of this current, due to the divergence closest to the coast, caused by the offshore transport. At the end of the blocking event, the South Brazil Bight was occupied with warmed Coastal Waters (CW) and SACW, with intensified currents all over the domain and changes in the horizontal features in specific areas.},
