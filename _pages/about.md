I am a Brazilian oceanographer, working at the [Coastal Hydrodynamics Group](http://lhico.io.usp.br/) at the [University of São Paulo Oceanographic Institute](http://www3.io.usp.br/) and interested in continental shelf processes and their interaction with open ocean. I'm on the third year of my PhD, where I use a combination of numerical simulations with observational data analysis to study salty and warm subsurface intrusions in the South Brazil Bight, which can be an important mechanism to insert head and mass into the shelf.

I received my B.S. in oceanography and my M.Sc. in physical oceanography both from the University of São Paulo (2016 and 2019, respectively). As an undergraduate I worked with Dr. [Marcelo Dottori](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=50Z00wUAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR&oi=ao) and [Belmiro Mendes Castro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=805HS9cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR&oi=sra) to investigate hypothetical scenarios of nuclear leakage in the Angra dos Reis (RJ, Brazil) power plant. As a graduate student, my work was to explore how atmospheric blocking events affect the shelf circulation and thermodynamics, since these events are known to increase the incoming shortwave radiation and block synoptic wind patterns. Check our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2021.101815) to know more.

In addition to my work as a researcher, I am trying to bring state-of-the-art tools from the data science world into the lab, to become the researcher's life easier. For instance, I am working with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) containerization to encapsulate the [Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS)](https://www.myroms.org/) and to prevent every new researcher from our group to go through the installation process. 

Outside academia, I provide freelance data analyst services for the renewable energy sector. Among the services, I work with meteo-oceanographic information (observed and modeled), global reanalysis, develop pipelines to operationalize workflows (using [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)), like download, pre and postprocessing of satelite products and global datasets.
